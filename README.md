# Brilliant-Hummingbirds
Biogeographic analyses for the brilliant hummingbird clade.The **Brilliants** are a loosely defined clade of hummingbirds with ranges across many elevations mainly in north and northwestern South America. Here we use a new tree for the clade to ask questions about biogeographic history, dispersal, origins of endemism, and maybe some trait evolution?
